# Customer-churn-analysis
Forecast and prediction project- predicting the probability of churn from a gym club.

The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data. 
One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. 
Churn is defined by the gym when a customer doesn't come for a month. 
In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. 
Our task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.

In this project we will:
• predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer
• Draw up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features
• Analyze the factors that impact churn most
• Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service:
  o Identify target groups
  o Suggest measures to cut churn
  o Describe any other patterns you see with respect to interaction with customers
